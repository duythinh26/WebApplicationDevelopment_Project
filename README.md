## YOUR TOPIC
E-COMMERCE WEBSITE

Ecommerce stands for “electronic commerce.” Ecommerce websites are built to connect shoppers to products or services for trading online. On the most basic level, they provide everything we need for online shopping. They work like this:

- A business builds the website and lists the products or services they sell, along with prices. (There are a ton of ecommerce platforms out there that make it easier to start your online business.)
- A customer finds the website, then buys goods and services. When they’ve decided they’re done online shopping, they move to the checkout phase.
- Following the website’s checkout process, the buyer provides the necessary payment and shipping information.
- The ecommerce website sends the payment information through a payment processor that validates the payment and collects the funds.
- The seller then ships the order to the customer or sends the digital product immediately via email.

## MOTIVATION

Build a basic website help us to learn more skill in code, font-end and back-end field. With an E-commerce website, it even improves the database management skill in business. When we finished, the project can basically show us how difficult that the big brand like Tiki, Lazada, Shopee control their business work, not only build a security website but also manage a huge database that come every day, and they still success. We aiming to that goal and take this project topic as a motivation to complete it.

### Challenges in the project.
With a E-commerce website, the most hardest part is the back-end. Because you do not need an catchy or colorful website to attract customer, of course it still important but not the most one. If your website has a thousand people visit every day, and the back-end not safe enough, there will has a lot of risk (bad security, hacker, leaking customer information,...).
